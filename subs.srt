They were unarmed.

901
01:27:43,339 --> 01:27:48,301
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

- Where is Mama?
EOWYN: Shh.

904
01:27:53,641 --> 01:27:57,978
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

905
01:27:57,979 --> 01:28:02,979
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

Draw him away from your women

His men will return
and fight for their king.

They will be 300 leagues from here

He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

931

There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

He thinks he's leading them to safety.

I must.

Go, Frodo.

The battle for Middle-earth

All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits...

"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
